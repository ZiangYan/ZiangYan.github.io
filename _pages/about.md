I am currently a PhD student at Tsinghua University. I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2015 and 2018.

My major research interest is on the adversarial example, which I believe will tell us a lot about the limitation of current machine learning paradigm.

Moreover, I has been very interested in cyber security and cryptography since senior high school. In 2018, I launched a small ETH blockchain based game named AlchemyGod together with my classmates.
