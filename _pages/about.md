I am currently a PhD student at Tsinghua University. I obtained my bachelor and master degrees from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2015 and 2018.

My major research interest is on the adversarial example, which I believe will tell us a lot about the limitation of current machine learning paradigm.

I am also highly interested in the blockchain technology, and I have launched a small ETH based game named [AlchemyGod](https://www.pencilnews.cn/p/18097.html) with my classmates.
