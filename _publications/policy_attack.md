To craft black-box adversarial examples, adversaries need to query the victim model and take proper advantage of its feedback. Existing black-box attacks generally suffer from high query complexity, especially when only the top-1 decision (i.e., the hard-label prediction) of the victim model is available. 
In this paper, we propose a novel hard-label black-box attack named Policy-Driven Attack, to reduce the query complexity. 
Our core idea is to learn promising search directions of the adversarial examples using a well-designed policy network in a novel reinforcement learning formulation, in which the queries become more sensible. 
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce the query
complexity in comparison with existing state-of-the-art hard-label black-box attacks on various image classification benchmark datasets
