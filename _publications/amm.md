In this paper, we analyze the generalization ability of DNNs comprehensively and attempt to improve it from a geometric point of view.
We propose adversarial margin maximization (AMM), a learning-based regularization which exploits an adversarial perturbation as a proxy. 
It encourages a large margin in the input space, just like the support vector machines.
